# Smart-Traffic-Mangement-System
Smart and new way to manage Traffic.
A smart vision-based traffic control system, automating traffic inspection tasks like number of vehicles, number plate recognition, and ambulance sign detection using advanced OCR and deep learning models, achieving over 92% accuracy in vehicle and quantity identification.
	Implemented  detection of emergency vehicles (ambulance, police cars, fire brigade vehicles) using CNN-based feature extraction and colour/texture analysis, enabling real-time assessment and reducing manual QC time by 60%.
	Optimized image preprocessing pipelines (light balancing, noise filtering, segmentation) to improve OCR and object detection accuracy under variable lighting and vehicle diversity scenarios
